# Temperature Variations Analysis & Visualization

# Overview
Welcome to the Temperature Variations Analysis & Visualization project! This repository contains a Python application that analyzes and visualizes temperature variations between two dissimilar environments. The goal is to provide insights into how temperature fluctuates in different settings, which can be valuable for environmental studies, energy management, urban planning, and more.

# Project Motivation
Understanding temperature variations is crucial for various industries and research fields. By comparing temperature data from two distinct environments (e.g., urban vs. rural, coastal vs. inland), we can:

Identify Climate Patterns: Detect trends and anomalies in temperature data.

Support Decision-Making: Inform policies related to energy consumption, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation.

Enhance Predictive Models: Improve weather forecasting and climate change models.

# Features
Data Collection: Import temperature data from CSV files or APIs.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.

Data Visualization:

Plotly: Generate interactive plots with zooming and hovering capabilities.

Comparative Analysis:

Compare temperature variations between the two environments side by side.

Visualize correlations and differences over time.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.12.3

Plotly: Interactive data visualization.

# Potential Applications
Energy Management: Optimize heating and cooling strategies based on temperature trends.

Environmental Research: Study the impact of urbanization on local climates.

Agriculture: Plan agricultural activities by understanding temperature patterns.

Public Policy: Inform policy decisions related to climate change and sustainability.
