# Weather Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes weather data from various locations, including Death Valley, Sitka, and San Francisco. The focus is on understanding temperature variations, daily highs and lows, and precipitation levels. The project aims to showcase data analysis skills such as data parsing, handling missing data, and creating informative visualizations using Matplotlib.

## Skills Demonstrated
Data Wrangling: Parsing and extracting useful information from CSV files.

Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib to create informative visualizations of temperature and rainfall trends.

Handling Missing Data: Implementing error handling to manage incomplete datasets.

## Key Features
### Daily High and Low Temperature Analysis:

Visualizes temperature trends for multiple locations, highlighting daily high and low temperatures.

Locations analyzed: Death Valley, CA; Sitka, AK; and San Francisco, CA.

### Rainfall Visualization:

Visualizes daily rainfall data for Sitka, showcasing precipitation trends throughout 2021.

### Handling Missing Data:

The project includes handling missing data points, ensuring robustness in real-world data scenarios.

## Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for data manipulation and visualization.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations of temperature and rainfall trends.

CSV: Data files are processed using Pythonâ€™s CSV module.

Pathlib: For file handling and reading data from CSV files.

## Future Improvements
Real-time Data Integration: Integrating real-time weather data to keep the analysis updated.

Interactive Visualizations: Using libraries such as Plotly for creating interactive graphs.

Additional Locations: Expanding the analysis to cover more geographical locations.

## Data Sources
Weather Data: The weather data for this project is sourced from various CSV files containing daily temperature and precipitation information for the respective locations.

## How to Run
### Clone the repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-data-analysis.git

### Install dependencies:

This project requires Python and Matplotlib. Install the required packages using:

bash

Copy code

pip install matplotlib

### Run the Python scripts:

You can run each script to visualize weather data from different locations. For example, to analyze Death Valley's temperature data, use:

bash

Copy code

python death_valley_highs_lows.py

### Similarly, you can run the other scripts to generate visualizations for Sitka and San Francisco weather data.
